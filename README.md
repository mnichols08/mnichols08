# On a Mission to Kick Down The Door into Tech

## About Me

Hello! I'm Mikey, currently working as a Sales Associate based in the scenic state of West Virginia. I have a deep passion for technology, which I pursue during my free time by learning new languages and contributing to various web projects.

### My Learning Journey

- My primary platforms for continuous learning include [Chingu Voyages](https://chingu.io) and the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io). These platforms have been instrumental in not only honing my technical skills but also connecting me with like-minded individuals, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Through these communities, I‚Äôve participated in numerous projects that simulate real-world scenarios, further solidifying my knowledge and experience.
- Additionally, I've earned several certifications from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org), which have significantly expanded my understanding of web development concepts. These certifications cover various aspects of programming including front-end development, data visualization, APIs, and microservices.
- By leveraging these resources, I've built a strong foundation in coding principles and continue to stay updated with the latest industry advancements.
- I discovered these valuable learning resources through Udemy, where I have completed numerous courses taught by renowned instructors such as Angela Yu, Jonas Schmedtmann, Colt Steele, Anthony Alicea, Brad Traversy, among others. Their expert guidance has been indispensable in deepening my understanding of web development.
- To consolidate my knowledge and keep track of key takeaways from these courses, I created a dedicated repository for my digital notes. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource documenting my learning journey. Feel free to check it out at [https://github.com/mnichols08/educational-courses](https://github.com/mnichols08/educational-courses).

### Beyond Coding

### Skills and Interests

I specialize in JavaScript fundamentals but am always eager to explore more about web technologies. One of my greatest joys is helping others learn and grow in their coding journey‚Äîbe it through code reviews or collaborative projects.

When I'm not immersed in code:

- You might find me carving the slopes on my snowboard, riding my skateboard at the local park or hiking through the forest.

- I used to travel and ultimately would love to get back to this but for now I don't have the means.
